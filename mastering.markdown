Eloise Montalvo has been involved in the Austin music scene since 2021, playing shows, running
sound, recording, mixing, mastering, and more. She is currently accepting work for mastering which
can be discussed via email at [eloise@emote.ch][email] or via Instagram DM [@eloise.rgb][instagram].

### Mastering Engineer Credits

### Sample Work

 * [*False Memories* - rebecka][rebecka_false_memories]

[MP3 48kHz 320kbps, both normalized to -12LUFS for the sake of comparison]

{% include embed-audio-ab.html id="sample-rebecka" src-a="/assets/samples/False Memories - rebecka (Before Mastering).mp3" src-b="/assets/samples/False Memories - rebecka (After Mastering).mp3" label-a="Before" label-b="After" %}

In this sample, you can notice a stark difference between the Before and After, primarily in terms
of muddiness. The original source was minimally mixed on a cassette portastudio and the artist
requested that some extra EQing be done to improve the audibility. A more standard master can be
heard in the Bad Luck Penny EP above, however I don't have an A/B sample available at this time.

### Process & Hardware

My usual process includes some light saturation and compression, followed by a limiter and clipper.
I adjust each of these stages according to the genre and artist notes. My hardware includes a pair
of Kali Audio LP-UNFs and when mastering for tape, a TEAC A-550RX. Otherwise I work solely in-box
and make sanity checks with QSC K12.2s and a couple of smaller low-quality speakers.
